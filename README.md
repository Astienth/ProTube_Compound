Dual Wielding

You can use two different ProTube feedback gear (like two ProVolvers) to dual wield in this game. But you have to tell the mod once which of the weapons you hold in your right and which in your left hand, otherwise it cannot guess that. So, here's how to do that:

Start up the game and let the ProTubes connect, and try some shooting. If left and right are already in the correct place, you are done and have to do nothing, maybe still read point 3 here.
If left and right are switched, quit out of the game. In the game directory, in the folder UserData, there will now be two files called rightHand.pro and leftHand.pro. Just switch them (rename left to right, and the other way around). That's it.
If you play another dual wielding ProTube mod of mine, you can simply copy these files to the UserData directory of that game, they simply contain the name and serial number of your gear, and which hand it is assigned to.
